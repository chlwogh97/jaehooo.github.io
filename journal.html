                <p>During week 1, we learned about the design process, design concepts and ways to make user centred designs. I also managed to form a group of 3 to last for the semester, including myself, John Antonios and Han Yi Peng. We were told to make
                    a UI for an autonomous vehicle for our major project for the semester.<br><br>During week 2 tutorial, we were taught how to draw a stakeholder map. As a group, we thought of three ideas for autonomous vehicles - wheelchair, ambulance
                    and garbage truck since they all fit into the criteria of 'moving something from one point to another'.<br><br>We then moved onto researches and studies to figure out if there are existing studies regarding the mentioned vehicles above,
                    and round that autonomous wheelchairs are already in production stage and there already are numerous research papers for the vehicle. Additionally, we agreed that for an autonomous ambulance, it would not be easy to gather data and
                    interviews from paramedics and medical practitioners.<br><br>THANK GOD, not a lot of people thought of autonomous garbage trucks! There were a lot of information about the current system because it's run by the council, however not
                    a lot of studies were present about autonomous garbage vehicles that are ready to be out for practical use.<br><br>So we went with that idea.<br><br></p>

                <p>So we decided to go with autonomous garbage trucks. We managed to gather as much second hand research as possible regarding the current system, then we researched some user researched methods that would be beneficial for the project. Then
                    we came up with 3 distinct methods: <strong>Online Survey | Focus Groups | Card Sorting</strong><br><br>I personally went on and did focus groups with residents, asking them a series of questions about their experiences with the current
                    garbage collection system and their opinions on how to improve the system.<br><br>And from key insights, we've made a variety of personas to suit the needs of residents with different needs and situation. Progressively, we've made
                    individual reports and presented it. The visual report elicits design problems, research results, personas, and synthesis developed from them.<br><br><br></p>

                <p>In week 5 after our individual presentations, we collated all user research data from the first assessment, then made key insights. One of the most significant problems common in our findings was 'freedom of garbage collection through
                    bin days'.<br><br>Making this issue the key element of our future researches, as a group we came up with 4 concepts:<br><br></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Autonomous garbage robots replacing garbage trucks<br></li>
                    <li>Personal garbage robot bins for each household<br></li>
                    <li>Autonomous underground chute<br></li>

            </div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                <p>As apart of our ideation process, we managed to create 3 storyboards for each ideas, making it 12.<br><br>In week 6 after evaluating on the 4 concepts, we have chosen our two strongest idea - Autonomous bins and garbage collection robots,
                    because realistically speaking, the chute and the drone system had too many downsides for practical use. We then moved onto discussing low-fidelity prototypes for those two ideas, where we thought of 3D printing a phone and having
                    a slide of sketched screens to use as a prototype. We also discussed various user evaluations such as a/b testing, click testing and think-aloud.<br><br>On the next week, we came up with an agreement that instead of paperproto and
                    using 3D printed phone, it's more cost-efficient and easier to use a mobile app such as InVision and Marvel as they support more digital, still lo-fi prototyping while they allow users to physically interact with the sketched UI by
                    tapping on the screen.<br><br>We were challenged with an obstacle when our tutor criticized our second idea - personal robot bins, as it lacked interactions that the users can make with the UI and the vehicle as the features would
                    only consist of users pressing some buttons and sending out the robot for it to carry out its only task - dispose bins and return. So we had to bring in a new idea - a UI for the council to operate a robot rental service where residents
                    can call/book in for a pickup at the desired time, then the operator designated for the sector approves then sends the robot out. The feature would include booking management, other logistics based services and reporting incidents
                    to other authorities.<br><br>To be more in depth, we decided to design UI for both ends of the perspective - the council and the residents. This will maximize the field of interaction. For data gathering, we have managed to call up
                    the council and receive some information and opinion from the customer service representative as they would be our target stakeholder for this design.<br></p>

                <p>On week 8, we were still on our way to finish the extended storyboards with 12 frames each and create lo-fi prototypes. We decided that it was ideal to grab 8 resident and operator participants for the first idea, and 8 operator participants
                    for the second idea.<br><br>We also thought of useful user evaluation methods that could be utilised:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Concurrent Think Aloud (CTA)</strong> - to understand participants' thoughts as they attempt to work through issues they encounter<br></li>

                    <li><strong>System Usability Scale</strong> - participants are asked to score 10 questions with a score from 1 - 5 from Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree. The questions mainly target the overall usability of the system and and asks how
                        users feel about using the UI.<br></li>

                    This made it a bit difficult to find someone who has experience in management, therefore we decided to broaden our spectrum so instead of looking for people with experiences in customer/logistics/service management, we agreed that

                <p>We got to the final stage of high fidelity prototype production where as a group we went through the interaction. We realised that there were some iterations to be made to refine the overall aesthetics and functionalities of the website.<br><br>To
                    make the UI more fluid, we decided to use prototyping tools to add animations and make the system more interactive. Since we were familiar with InVision as we created our lo-fi prototype with it, we went ahead to try InVision Studio.
                    However the software lacked micro-interactions and some features that we wanted to use, and it felt more of a mid-fi prototyping instead of hi-fi.<br><br>We then tried to use Atomic, however the fact that it's a web-based program made
                    the whole system buggy and slowed our process down. Then came the discovery of Framer. The software provided us with multiple features that we needed to use for our prototyping.<br><br>One of the downsides was the fact that our entire
                    system is based with a side navigation bar, however there are no methods of having a fixed side navbar, but only the header and the footer. This created a conflict of either giving up adding majority of the animations for the prototype
                    to be seamless, or having animations, but lacking the natural feel that websites have.<br><br>Using Framer, we managed to add some extra features such as pop up boxes where necessary to improve the overall interaction between the interface
                    and the users. Additionally, we thought that it would be more visually appealing to apply 3D maps in pages that require maps and it was agreed that some users that need extra help with finding directions and locations would benefit
                    from using this feature.<br><br>To finalise our assessment, our group member John has got his friend as the narrator to help with the walkthrough video of the high fidelity prototype. Assessment 4 was submitted on the 25th of October
                    2018.<br><br></p>
